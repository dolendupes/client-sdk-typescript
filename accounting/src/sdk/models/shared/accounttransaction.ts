 * > **Language tip:** In Codat, account transactions represent all transactions posted to a bank account within an accounting platform.

 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * In Codat’s data model, account transactions represent bank activity within an accounting platform. All transactions that go through a bank account are recorded as account transactions.
 *
 * Account transactions are created as a result of different business activities, for example:
 *
 * * Payments: for example, receiving money for payment against an invoice.
 * * Bill payments: for example, spending money for a payment against a bill.
 * * Direct costs: for example, withdrawing money from a bank account, either for cash purposes or to make a payment.
 * * Direct incomes: for example, selling an item directly to a contact and receiving payment at point of sale.
 * * Transfers: for example, transferring money between two bank accounts.
 *
 * Account transactions is the parent data type of [payments](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Payment), [bill payments](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/BillPayment), [direct costs](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/DirectCost), [direct incomes](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/DirectIncome), and [transfers](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Transfer).

     * Rate to convert the total amount of the payment into the base currency for the company at the time of the payment.
     *
     * @remarks
     *
     * Currency rates in Codat are implemented as the multiple of foreign currency units to each base currency unit.
     *
     * Where the currency rate is provided by the underlying accounting platform, it will be available from Codat with the same precision (up to a maximum of 9 decimal places).
     *
     * For accounting platforms which do not provide an explicit currency rate, it is calculated as `baseCurrency / foreignCurrency` and will be returned to 9 decimal places.
     *
